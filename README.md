# HTML-Course

I'm making a portfilio website over the spring break, HTML course from codecademt is step 1. Here are just some random files from the course.

This was overall a very solid course and introduced me to basic tags, semantic HTML, forms, tables and client side validation.

Here are some images of little projects I worked on (mainly guided) also it only looks nice because codecademy provides css (css not by me!!)
